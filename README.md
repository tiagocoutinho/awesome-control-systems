A curated list of awesome control systems resources.

Control systems are everywhere: from small university labs to big facilites like particle accelerators, light, neutron and laser sources, telescopes, space stations, factories.

The list is starting as a biased, limited view of the control system landscape.

Leveraging the balance is only possible with your help. PRs are most welome. The lists are alphabetically ordered. Please respect that order in your PRs.

## General purpose control systems

* [Epics](https://epics.anl.gov/) - a set of Open Source software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes and other large scientific experiments.
* [Karabo](https://in.xfel.eu/readthedocs/docs/karabo/en/latest/index.html) -
* [NICOS](https://nicos-controls.org/) - a network-based control system written for neutron scattering instruments, originally at the MLZ. Its main goals are flexibility, ease of use and maintenance, and reusability.
* [Tango](https://tango-controls.org) - a free open source device-oriented toolkit for controlling any kind of hardware or software and building SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system
* [Unicos](https://unicos.web.cern.ch/) - a CERN-made framework to develop industrial control applications. It deals with the two upper layers of a classical control system: Supervision and Control


## Orchestrators

* [Bliss](https://bliss.gitlab-pages.esrf.fr/bliss/master/)
* [Bluesky](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/)
* [Concert](https://concert.rtfd.io/)
* [OpenGDA](www.opengda.org/)
* [Sardana](https://sardana-controls.org/)


## Detectors

* [AreaDetector](https://areadetector.github.io/)
* [Lima](https://lima1.rtfd.io)
* [UFO](https://ufo-core.rtfd.io)

## Instrumentation/Laboratory libraries/frameworks

* [Lantz](https://lantz.rtfd.io) - an automation and instrumentation toolkit. Provides a core with
  commonly used functionalities for building applications that communicate with scientific instruments.
  as a glue language to wrap existing drivers and DLLs.
* [Instrumental](https://instrumental-lib.rtfd.io) - Python-based instrumentation library from the Mabuchi Lab.
* [InstrumentKit](https://instrumentkit.rtfd.io) - Python package for interacting with laboratory equipment over various buses.
* [PyExpLabSys](https://pyexplabsys.rtfd.io) - python code useful in experimental labs, such 
  as equipment drivers, data logging and network data exchange components.
* [PyNTA](https://python-nta.rtfd.io) - Particle tracking instrumentation and analysis in Python
* [PYME](https://python-microscopy.org/) - PYthon Microscopy Environment. Image acquisition and data 
  analysis functionality for a number of microscopy applications, with a particular emphasis on single
  molecule localisation microscopy (PALM/STORM/PAINT)
* [PyMeasure](https://pymeasure.rtfd.io) - Scientific measurement library for instruments, experiments, and live-plotting.
* [storm-control](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/storm-control) - Zhuang lab control system
* [UUTrack](https://uutrack.rtfd.io) - A powerful interface for scientific cameras and instruments
