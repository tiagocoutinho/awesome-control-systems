A curated list of awesome control systems resources.

Control systems are everywhere: from small university labs to big facilites like particle accelerators, light, neutron and laser sources, telescopes, space stations, factories.

The list is starting as a biased, limited view of the control system landscape.

Leveraging the balance is only possible with your help. PRs are most welome. The lists are alphabetically ordered. Please respect that order in your PRs.
